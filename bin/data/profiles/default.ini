# This is the default profile that gets used when no other profile is specified. This is meant as a 
# general case profile and may not match your needs exactly. This does not have the perfect quality but aims for
# a good balance of quality and speed and compatibility. You can copy this file and rename it to make
# your own profiles. You can then use your new profile when starting the movie like this:
# startmovie a.mp4 my_profile
# The above command will select the my_profile.ini file in this same directory.

# The constant framerate to use for the movie. Whole numbers only.
video_fps=60

# The video encoder to use for the movie. Available options are *libx264* or *libx264rgb*.
# For YUV video, *libx264* is used. For RGB video, *libx264rgb* is used.
# There may be compatibility issues with *libx264rgb* but it produces the highest quality.
video_encoder=libx264

# The constant rate factor to use for the movie. This is the direct link between quality and file size.
# Using 0 here produces lossless video, but may cause the video stream to not be supported in some media programs.
# This should be between 0 and 52. A lower value means better quality but larger file size.
video_x264_crf=15

# The quality vs speed to use for encoding the movie.
# This can be one of *ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo*.
# A slower preset will produce slightly better quality but will significantly slow down the producing process.

# This decides whether or not the resulting video stream will consist only of keyframes.
# This essentially disables any compression and will greatly increase the file size, but makes video editing very fast.

# How much to multiply the movie framerate with. The product of this is how many samples per second

# Velocity overlay
#################################################################

# Whether or not the velocity overlay is enabled.
# The velocity overlay will show the velocity of the current player. In case of multiplayer games with spectating,
